    <h1>Let's talk about football</h1>

        Unqualified, the
        word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports
        commonly
        called football include association football (known as soccer in North America and Oceania); gridiron football
        (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby union and rugby league;
        and
        Gaelic football.[1] These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as
